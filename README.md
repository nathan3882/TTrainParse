# BrockTrainParse

BrockTrainParse is an easy to use program that allows a Brockenhurst College student to upload his/her college timetable and the app will infer the required day, and it's start – finish times, to seamlessly integrate with South Western Railways public database via the use of SOAP / XML requests.<br><br>All the user must do is send a screenshot of the timetable with any amount of external information and hey presto.<br><br>
Initially thought up to diagnose a wide spread issue for all commuters to Brockenhurst College constantly flicking between multiple internet reliant applications and websites to find out when your trains are. With this, I’ve utilised different data storage methods to cache all results to allow usage with Or without internet access.
